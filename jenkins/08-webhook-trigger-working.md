## 🔔 How Is a Jenkins Pipeline Triggered Using a Git Webhook?

This explains **end-to-end** how a **Git webhook automatically triggers a Jenkins pipeline**, with a **real example and flow**.

---

## 🧠 What is a Git Webhook?

A **Git webhook** is a real-world implementation of an **HTTP callback**.

👉 When a Git event occurs, Git **calls back** Jenkins using an HTTP request.

---

## 🌐 What is an HTTP Callback? (Core Concept)

### 🧠 Definition

An **HTTP callback** is an **HTTP request sent by one system to another system to notify it that an event has occurred**.

👉 Instead of repeatedly checking (polling), the sender **notifies automatically**.

---

### 📞 Simple Analogy

* ❌ Polling: *"Did something happen? Did something happen?"*
* ✅ Callback: *"I’ll call you when it happens."*

That **call** = HTTP callback ☎️

---

### 🔔 HTTP Callback in Git → Jenkins

| Role              | System                |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Event creator     | Git (GitHub / GitLab) |
| Callback sender   | Git                   |
| Callback receiver | Jenkins               |

---

### 🔄 Callback Flow (Important)

```
Developer Action
   ↓
Git Server creates event
   ↓
Git sends HTTP POST (callback)
   ↓
Jenkins webhook endpoint
   ↓
Pipeline is triggered
```

---

### 📦 Callback Payload (Simplified)

```
POST /github-webhook/
{
  "event": "push",
  "repo": "payment-service",
  "branch": "main",
  "commit": "abc123"
}
```

---

## ⚡ How Is a Git Event Created? (Very Important)

A **Git event is created automatically inside the Git server** when a specific action happens in the repository.

### 🧩 Common Git Events

Git providers generate events for actions like:

* 📤 `push` (most common for CI)
* 🔀 `pull_request` / `merge_request`
* 🏷️ `tag creation`
* 🗑️ branch delete

---

## 🔄 Internal Git Event Creation Flow

```
Developer Action
   ↓
Git Client (git push)
   ↓
Git Server (GitHub/GitLab)
   ↓
Event Created (push event)
   ↓
Webhook Fired
```

👉 Event creation happens **inside Git**, not Jenkins.

---

## 🧪 Example: Push Event Creation (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Developer runs git command

```
git add .
git commit -m "Fix payment bug"
git push origin main
```

---

### Step 2: Git Server Receives Push

Git server performs:

* Validates user authentication
* Updates branch (`main`)
* Stores commit object

---

### Step 3: Git Creates an Event

Git internally creates a **push event object** containing:

* Repository name
* Branch name
* Commit SHA
* Author
* Timestamp

This event exists **even if no webhook is configured**.

---

### Step 4: Webhook Is Triggered (If Configured)

If a webhook exists:

```
Event → Webhook Dispatcher → Jenkins URL
```

Git sends an HTTP POST request with event payload.

---

## 📦 Sample Webhook Payload (Simplified)

```
{
  "event": "push",
  "repository": "payment-service",
  "ref": "refs/heads/main",
  "commit": "a1b2c3",
  "author": "Mukesh"
}
```

---

## 🧠 Important Clarifications (Interview Gold)

* ✅ Git events are **always created** on actions
* ❌ Webhooks do **not create events**
* 🔔 Webhooks only **deliver events** to external systems

---

## 🆚 Git Event vs Webhook

| Git Event                 | Webhook                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Created internally by Git | HTTP delivery mechanism    |
| Happens on repo action    | Happens only if configured |
| Exists always             | Optional                   |

---

## 🎯 Why Webhooks Are Preferred

* ⚡ Instant build trigger
* 🚫 No unnecessary polling
* 📉 Less load on Jenkins & Git
* ✅ Industry best practice

---

## 🧩 High-Level Flow (Webhook Trigger)

```
👨‍💻 Developer
      ↓
📤 Git Push (commit)
      ↓
🔔 Git Webhook Event
      ↓
🌐 Jenkins Webhook Endpoint
      ↓
🚀 Jenkins Pipeline Starts
```

---

## 1️⃣ Step 1: Developer Pushes Code

Example:

```
git commit -m "Add login validation"
git push origin main
```

This push generates a **push event** in Git.

---

## 2️⃣ Step 2: Git Sends Webhook to Jenkins

Git provider sends an HTTP POST request to Jenkins:

```
POST http://jenkins.example.com/github-webhook/
```

Payload includes:

* Repository name
* Branch name
* Commit ID
* Author

---

## 3️⃣ Step 3: Jenkins Receives Webhook

Jenkins has a **webhook endpoint** exposed by a plugin:

| Git Provider | Endpoint           |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| GitHub       | `/github-webhook/` |
| GitLab       | `/gitlab-webhook/` |
| Bitbucket    | `/bitbucket-hook/` |

Jenkins validates the request and maps it to jobs.

---

## 4️⃣ Step 4: Jenkins Matches Job / Pipeline

Jenkins checks:

* Which job uses this repository?
* Does branch match?
* Is webhook trigger enabled?

If matched → Jenkins schedules the pipeline.

---

## 5️⃣ Step 5: Jenkinsfile Is Loaded

Jenkins:

* Clones the repository
* Reads the `Jenkinsfile`
* Parses the pipeline

```
repo/
 ├── app-code/
 └── Jenkinsfile
```

---

## 6️⃣ Step 6: Pipeline Execution Starts

Example Jenkinsfile:

```
pipeline {
  agent any
  triggers {
    githubPush()
  }
  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        echo 'Building...'
      }
    }
    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        echo 'Testing...'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

👉 `githubPush()` tells Jenkins to react to GitHub webhooks.

---

## 📌 Real-World Example (End-to-End)

### Scenario

* Repo: `payment-service`
* Branch: `main`
* Jenkins job: Multibranch Pipeline

### Flow

```
Code Push to main
      ↓
GitHub Webhook
      ↓
Jenkins Multibranch Pipeline
      ↓
Jenkinsfile detected
      ↓
Pipeline triggered automatically
```

Each branch gets its **own pipeline run**.

---

## 🆚 Webhook vs Poll SCM (Internal Difference)

| Webhook         | Poll SCM    |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Event-driven    | Time-based  |
| Instant trigger | Delayed     |
| Efficient       | Inefficient |
| Preferred       | Legacy      |

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

* Use **secret token** in webhook
* Restrict Jenkins endpoint access
* Use HTTPS

---

## 🎤 Interview Golden Explanation

> “When a developer pushes code, Git sends a webhook event to Jenkins. Jenkins matches the repository and branch, loads the Jenkinsfile, and triggers the pipeline automatically without polling.”

---

## 💡 Pro Interview Tip

> “In multibranch pipelines, webhooks trigger branch indexing, which then triggers the correct pipeline.”
